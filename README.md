# Competa-Address-book-API
this an assignment of competa where i have to make a Address-book with the random user api

The problems I found while making this assignment where:
understanding fetch.
understanding how you can open a json file with java.

making a listener for the divs that are made in the loop in the fetch. The problem with this was that fetch is automatic a promise and because I finnaly understood the fetch method for loading in api's I declined to change it to a normal xhttp function. It took a while before I understood the fetch function. If what I think is correct.
